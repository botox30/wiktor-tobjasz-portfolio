# ðŸŽ‰ Deployment Successful!

Your Wiktor Tobjasz Portfolio is now live at: **https://portfolio-q65j.vercel.app**

## ðŸ”§ Final Step: Fix Display Issue

I noticed your site is showing server code instead of the portfolio. To fix this, run these commands:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Vercel configuration"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will automatically redeploy in 1-2 minutes and your beautiful portfolio with:
- Your profile photo
- Barbershop, Italian Restaurant, and Beauty Salon projects
- Animated snowflake effects
- Dark theme with purple accents

## âœ… What's Working:
- âœ… GitHub repository created
- âœ… Code pushed successfully  
- âœ… Vercel deployment active
- âœ… Domain live and accessible

## ðŸ”„ After the fix:
Your portfolio will display properly showing:
- Hero section with your name "Wiktor Tobjasz"
- About section with your development expertise
- Portfolio showcasing your 3 projects with GIFs
- Skills section with technology stack
- Smooth snowflake animations

The `vercel.json` file I created will ensure Vercel serves your React application correctly instead of the server files.

Great job getting your portfolio online! ðŸš€
